player movement:

// Player can be in one of the following states:
- jumping
- falling
- walking

Player is jumping if:
- they were on the ground - chk
- the cardboard trigger/ space was pressed and held for less than 0.5 seconds - chk

Player is walking if:
- they were on the ground - chk
- the cardboard trigger/space was pressed and held for longer than 0.5 seconds - chk

// falling is likely the default state of the player and does not need to be coded
Player is falling if:
- they are in the air
- the cardboard trigger/space was not triggered

void FixedUpdate(){
	
	if(player is grounded){
		if(trigger beingheld){
			startTimer();
		}
		if(trigger beingheld){
			if(timer >= 0.5 seconds)
				walk()
		}
		if(trigger released)
		{
			if(timer < 0.5 seconds)
				jump()
			else
				stopWalk()
		}
	}
}


Platform distance:
- Platform should be far enough away from player so that when the player jumps they can jump
  from the center of one platform to the center of the platform they are jumping to
  assuming that both platforms are standing still

- Current player jumping statistics:
  - Jump speed: 8
  - Gravity: 5
  - Horizontal speed: 4

- assuming the player moves about 1 unit per second
  - they are in the air for 8/5 -> 1.6 seconds
  - and move about 6.4 units
- ... after doing some iteration it seems that the player moves
  approx. 25 units.. however that works...

- I have concluded that each platform should be about 25 units ahead of the other
